<h2>Memory</h2>
<p>
    Memory is a thing of great value and a key point. In case you forgot who you were. "This is Ted."
</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>
    Remembering is precious now! And unfortunately the government does not let you remember. 
    This is an extreme version of government control.

<h1>✞ (Words)</h1>
<h2>AI</h2>
<p>Press any button on your keyboard to get a new word.</p>
<p>
    The idea of this page is based off the late Terry Davis' idea of godspeak. 
    Terry believed that by generating this text one could "speak to God".
</p>
<p>
    Here is Terry showing off his idea of God Words. Please note that Terry suffered from extreme schizophrenia later in his life.
</p>

<p>
    The idea behind this page is that the words that show up are randomly generated by AI.
</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>

<h1>Forget</h1>
<p>
    The idea of gaining more memory is key here. At this point in time we are so advanced that the only way to gain more memory is to clear old memory.
    If you forget old things you can learn new things.

<h2>Truth</h2>
<p>
    Bill Adair believes that the future of fact checking is structured data. But what if he is wrong?

</p>
<p>
    Every contact and message is marked with a button that says "BELIEVE."

    In this reality, the distinction between fact and fiction has been so blurred that you are now in charge of fact checking everything that comes your way.

<h2>Memory</h2>
<p>
    Have you forgotten who Nemoy or Mary is? Press "SEE" to remind yourself.
</p>
<p>
    Memory is precious and you can only get more by forgetting old things you don't need anymore. Press "FORGET" to do so.

<h2>Consumerism</h2>
<p>
    Everything can be bought nowadays (for a price). Want to regain someone's trust? Pay for it back. Want to know a friends final thoughts? Pay up.
</p>
<h2>AI</h2>
<p>
    The concept of employing AI to revive someone who has already passed away is not novel. Currently, we can only pay to listen to the final words of our deceased friends, leaving the future to unfold with possibilities beyond our current understanding.
</p>

<h1>Store</h1>
<h2>Consumerism</h2>
<p>
    Bugs are the future of protein. Eat up!
</p>
<p>
    "Chefs are also optimistic about future consumption, with “no less than 36% of chefs expect to see a considerable rise in customer demand for insect-based proteins and foods” by 2040, according to research by GEA."

<h1>♫ (Music)</h1>
<h2>AI</h2>
<p>
    AI knows best! Nowadays, you don't pick your music. What you want to listen to is picked for you. Don't like it? Give it a thumbs down. Hope you like silence though...
